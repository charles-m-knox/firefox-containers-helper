# Changelog

This changelog contains all relevant changes between different versions of the extension.

## v0.0.16

* adds container JSON/CSV export feature in the options page
  * allows you to use an external editor (spreadsheet/text editor) to help manage your containers at a larger scale
    * complete import/export is not implemented! the feature is mainly useful for setting a large number of default URLs for containers
* adds the ability to control whether or not settings are saved over Firefox Sync, or simply locally
  * to access this, visit the Extension Preferences page
  * by default, sync is **opt-in**, you have to enable it in order for the settings to be pushed to sync.
    * settings will continue to persist locally otherwise
* fix the awkward css styling for default url labels that are either selected or currently hovered over - gray on gray is not visible ðŸ˜°
* start propagating settings to Firefox Sync, but still using local storage as the primary source of truth
  * currently, only *pushing* settings, not reading. I want to ensure that writing to Firefox Sync is stable, and then make the transition enabling read from sync.
  * had to specify the extensions UUID in `manifest.json`, see [here](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/extensions-and-the-add-on-id/#when-do-you-need-an-add-on-id)
* add `1.` through `9.` to the prefix of the mode selection menu to make power users even more powerful (you can just press `3` on your keyboard to get the action you want)

## v0.0.15

* fix [#14](https://github.com/charles-m-knox/firefox-containers-helper/issues/14), to use non-localized AMO links
* fix [#15](https://github.com/charles-m-knox/firefox-containers-helper/issues/15), to enable Mac support for anything that uses the `Ctrl` key modifier to allow the `Meta` (`Cmd` key) modifier to work as well
* minor change: set text color to white when items are selected; previously text was black and the background highlight color was also dark gray, making it hard to see
* on Mac, the default shortcut key (`Alt+Shift+D`) is overridden by a built-in shortcut, so the new shortcut key on Mac is `Command+Shift+E`. You can change this if you want.

## v0.0.12-v0.0.14

* fix [#11](https://github.com/charles-m-knox/firefox-containers-helper/issues/11), the indexing for multi-select was using the total number of containers instead of the filtered number of containers ðŸ˜°
* re-add "+" button for containers since it's actually fine
* added stern warning to the readme about NEVER disabling or deleting all of your container extensions in Firefox, or else they'll get completely reset

## v0.0.11

* dark mode and light mode added in [#8](https://github.com/charles-m-knox/firefox-containers-helper/pull/8)
  * Thanks to https://github.com/KerfuffleV2 for this contribution!
* configurable keyboard shortcut added (see [#4](https://github.com/charles-m-knox/firefox-containers-helper/issues/4))
* adds *Select Mode*, as requested by the project's [first supporter](https://charlesmknox.com/supporters/#bob-haines)!
  * resolves [#6](https://github.com/charles-m-knox/firefox-containers-helper/issues/6)
* fix [#9](https://github.com/charles-m-knox/firefox-containers-helper/issues/9)... no longer drops all casing to lowercase when using "replace in name" mode, sorry about that!
* "replace in name" used to be case-insensitive, but I believe it's better to have case-sensitive replacing
  * Please file an issue and talk with me if you disagree or believe there should be a better approach! Thank you! ðŸ™‚
* added a small "Donate" link to my personal site with my personal avatar, I appreciate your support everyone ðŸ™‚
* added a simple "+" button to quickly add a new container based on the user's current input, this was requested [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/m0fvwy/the_multiaccount_containers_addon_is_awesome_but/gq8wqig?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
