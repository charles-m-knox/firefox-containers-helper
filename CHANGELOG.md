## v0.1.0

Significant rewrite of the extension, migrating from vanilla JS to TypeScript.

- Fixed verbiage in various places across the options page and extension popup
- Implemented "Confirm", "Prompt" and "Alert" modals instead of using the native JavaScript confirm() function
- Preferences page compatibility improvements
- Added "Refresh" function to allow for a faster way to delete & re-create an existing container or containers
  - Useful for quickly purging cookies without having to set up a container over again
- Added "Clean Up Orphans" to help clean up the config, with help text to show when it's needed
- Focus cancel/OK buttons in modals by default where necessary
- Stress-tested the extension and added suggestions/recommendations for extreme power users to the Preferences page
- Lots of other optimizations/fixes/improvements

Dev changes:

- Rewrote the extension in TypeScript. Uses webpack to compile the result.

## v0.0.28

- Container names no longer are limited to 25 characters. This was previously an API limitation that now seems to have been removed at some point, thank you Mozilla! As a result, the "Set Name" option now allows you to set a name longer than 25 characters. The "+" button did not have this same length check, so its behavior has not been changed.
- Replaced all javascript "alert" calls with proper modals. This is part of an incremental effort to replace all native JS dialogs such as "confirm", "prompt" and "alert" with proper CSS-enabled modals.
- Fix issue 40 - the Sort by URL Descending menu option is now correct.

## v0.0.27

- fixes issue 33 - in some scenarios, the selected items are preserved when they should be reset. Now, the behavior has been updated to de-select all containers when a delete or duplicate action takes place.

## v0.0.26

- the default sort was set to "URL ascending"; resetting it back to the default

## v0.0.25

- addresses some items from issue 37:
  - fixes issue with containers that are added via the `+` button having lowercase names
  - adds "soft" sorting by website asc/desc, container name asc/desc, or default unsorted/reverse
    - this does not actually change the sorting of your containers within Firefox; there is no API method that allows this that I'm aware of (see discussion in GH issue 37 comment 1232317252)
- minor code fixes/cleanup

## v0.0.24

- adds "Override with current tab's URL" feature requested in issue 31
- adds warning to the Preferences page about firefox sync quota limitations

## v0.0.23

- more verbiage clarification in options page

## v0.0.22

- minor verbiage fix in options page

## v0.0.21

- adds an option to override the default URL for a container with the current tab's URL if its domain/hostname/origin/host matches the current tab's URL
  - requested in issue 29
- minor syntax adjustments

## v0.0.20

- fixes a regression introduced in`v0.0.19` where tabs without default URLs would not be able to open when the setting to ignore non-http/https values was unchecked
- updated verbiage in the options page to remove double-negatives from the ignore http/https prompt options explanations

## v0.0.19

- fixes an issue where users can enter URLs without the protocol, which causes the web extensions API to attempt to load a local file by the name of the URL provided by the user. Users will now be prompted to confirm if they enter a URL that does not have `http://` or `https://` in front of it.
  - users are also prompted when attempting to open a URL without the above two protocols
  - added a section in the Preferences/options page where users can choose to ignore this dialog

## v0.0.18

- adds ability to import containers by providing a JSON array. This feature is accessible via the Addon Preferences page.
  - also includes ability to set default URLs for the containers
- fixed an issue with `undefined` container targets being passed to a request to delete multiple containers
- updated verbiage in the Export Containers section
- updated the Export Containers functionality to include the default URL for containers

## v0.0.17

- fixes GH issue #22 by enforcing a minimum search list height
- "No results" text added to the container list if there are no filtered results
- bug fix: no longer allows the enter key to trigger the selected action on the filtered containers, if there are no filtered containers

## v0.0.16

- adds container JSON/CSV export feature in the options page
  - allows you to use an external editor (spreadsheet/text editor) to help manage your containers at a larger scale
    - complete import/export is not implemented! the feature is mainly useful for setting a large number of default URLs for containers
- adds the ability to control whether or not settings are saved over Firefox Sync, or simply locally
  - resolves GH issue #3
  - to access this, visit the Extension Preferences page
  - by default, sync is **opt-in**, you have to enable it in order for the settings to be pushed to sync.
    - settings will continue to persist locally otherwise
  - had to specify the extensions UUID in `manifest.json`, see [here](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/extensions-and-the-add-on-id/#when-do-you-need-an-add-on-id)
- fix the awkward css styling for default url labels that are either selected or currently hovered over - gray on gray is not visible ðŸ˜°
- add `1.` through `9.` to the prefix of the mode selection menu to make power users even more powerful (you can just press `3` on your keyboard to get the action you want)

## v0.0.15

- fix GH issue #14, to use non-localized AMO links
- fix GH issue #15, to enable Mac support for anything that uses the `Ctrl` key modifier to allow the `Meta` (`Cmd` key) modifier to work as well
- minor change: set text color to white when items are selected; previously text was black and the background highlight color was also dark gray, making it hard to see
- on Mac, the default shortcut key (`Alt+Shift+D`) is overridden by a built-in shortcut, so the new shortcut key on Mac is `Command+Shift+E`. You can change this if you want.

## v0.0.12-v0.0.14

- fix GH issue #11, the indexing for multi-select was using the total number of containers instead of the filtered number of containers ðŸ˜°
- re-add "+" button for containers since it's actually fine
- added stern warning to the readme about NEVER disabling or deleting all of your container extensions in Firefox, or else they'll get completely reset

## v0.0.11

- dark mode and light mode added in GH pull request #8
  - Thanks to GH contributor KerfuffleV2 for this contribution!
- configurable keyboard shortcut added (see GH issue #4)
- adds *Select Mode*, as requested by a project supporter!
  - resolves GH issue #6
- fix GH issue #9... no longer drops all casing to lowercase when using "replace in name" mode, sorry about that!
- "replace in name" used to be case-insensitive, but I believe it's better to have case-sensitive replacing
  - Please file an issue and talk with me if you disagree or believe there should be a better approach! Thank you! ðŸ™‚
- added a small "Donate" link to my personal site with my personal avatar, I appreciate your support everyone ðŸ™‚
- added a simple "+" button to quickly add a new container based on the user's current input, this was requested [here](https://teddit.net/r/firefox/comments/m0fvwy/the_multiaccount_containers_addon_is_awesome_but/gq8wqig)

## v0.0.10

- new modes added:
  - Name Replace mode - Replaces a string in every matched container name
  - URL Replace mode - Replaces a string in every matched container URL
  - Set Color mode - Updates the color of all matched containers
  - Set Icon mode - Updates the icon of all matched containers
- use a dropdown field for selecting the current mode instead of checkboxes
- keep track of last query between popup close/open
- change "Stay Open" checkbox label to "Sticky Popup"
- simplified UI by removing buttons and labels
- provider better help messages
